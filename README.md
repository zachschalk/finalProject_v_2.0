# finalProject_v_2.0

This project is the result of work in an independent study focusing on data visualization at Georgetown University's Communication, Culture and Technology Program.

The data is accessed using the CFPB's CCDB API and the visualizations are made using D3.

The hope is that this tool can be useful for consumers looking to compare options in the consumer credit card market.
